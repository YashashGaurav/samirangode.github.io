I"¬<p>I am a Project Assistant at IISc working on project <a href="https://imprint-india.org/intelligent-water-supply-network-monitoring-and-control-for-equitable-distribution-of-water-within-a-mega-city-eqwater">EqWATER</a>. My work involves detecting leaks in a cyber-physical water distribution system which would be applied to the Bangalore water supply. Before this, I was an Area Manager Intern at Amazon for about 6 months. I have spent the summer after my junior year at TIFR, working on Image Processing and the summer after my sophomore year at Putzmeister, working on Robotics.</p>
